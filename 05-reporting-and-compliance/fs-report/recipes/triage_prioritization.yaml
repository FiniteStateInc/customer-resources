description: >
  Per-project vulnerability triage prioritization using a tiered-gates scoring model.
  Prioritizes findings based on reachability, exploitability, attack vector, EPSS, and CVSS.
  Gate 1: Reachable + Exploitable → CRITICAL. Gate 2: Not unreachable + NETWORK + EPSS > 90% → HIGH.
  Generates VEX triage recommendations (CRITICAL → IN_TRIAGE, unreachable → NOT_AFFECTED).
