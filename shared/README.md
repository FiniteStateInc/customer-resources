# Shared Resources

This directory contains shared utilities, API clients, and common helpers that are used across multiple examples and tools in this repository.

## Contents

- **[api-clients](./api-clients/)** - Reusable API client libraries and utilities
- **[common-helpers](./common-helpers/)** - Common helper functions, utilities, and shared code

## Usage

These shared resources are designed to:

- Reduce code duplication across examples
- Provide consistent API interaction patterns
- Offer reusable utilities for common tasks
- Maintain centralized configuration and authentication logic

When creating new examples or tools, consider using these shared resources rather than duplicating functionality.

## Contributing

If you're adding functionality that could be reused across multiple examples, consider adding it to the shared resources rather than keeping it example-specific. This helps maintain consistency and makes it easier for others to build upon your work.
